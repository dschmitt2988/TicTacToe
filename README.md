# TicTacToe
TicTacToe exercise in React focusing on communication between parent and child components 

About: Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React, you’ll manage state across parent and child components. You'll also work through the component lifecycle, by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: One feature that I was thinking would be cool, was to have photos instead of x and o to complete the game.  I figure that it would be a way in React to add the photos instead of the "x" or "o", but I would have to do more digging to figure out how to do that.  What I did find was that you can add the image with the src tag and use the URL of that image, but I need to figure out more about how to add it to the state to track the winner and so forth.  A second thing I noticed is that the player can currently "steal" a square, because you can click on the square again and it allows the "x" to change to and "o" or the opposite.  How I would work to change this is put in code that does not allow the square to be clicked on anymore, once the player has selected the x or the o for that square until the game has ended.
